Software architecture design for large applications is a very challenging task since it has to consider many objectives including some conflicting ones. The architecture is required to be efficient and to maintain friendly with modular and reusable components. Recommended security design principles may conflict with such efficient and reusable design. Thus, software architects have to deal with multiple design alternatives that need to be evaluated comprehensively to select the one that best matches the criteria of the specific context. To enable software architects make their decision prudently, Many-objective Evolutionary Algorithms have been used to effectively explore design alternatives on high dimensional objective spaces. In this paper, we have formulated a Many-objective optimization problem using ten maintenance and five security metrics relevant to architectural issues. We have also developed a modified and improved version of the popular Non-dominated Sorting based Algorithm (NSGAIII) using Fuzzy logic, which clearly outperforms other state-of-the-art many-objective optimization algorithms in this context.
